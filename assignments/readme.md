# LearnPyTorch.io Assignments ‚Äì Instructor Solutions

## üìå Disclaimer

These notebooks are my personal solutions to the assignments found on [LearnPyTorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/), completed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with the help of Colab‚Äôs autocomplete and documentation features.

I'm sharing these solutions publicly so that my students can:
- See a complete and working example of each assignment
- Understand how different parts of the code work
- Compare their own work and learn from alternate approaches

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for Students:** Please use this repo as a reference only. Try to complete each assignment on your own before checking the solutions‚Äîit's the best way to learn!

All credit for the course content goes to [Daniel Bourke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrdbourke/) and the creators of LearnPyTorch.io. This repo is purely for educational support.

## üõ† Tech Details
- Platform: Google Colab
- Tools: PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy, and others as used in the course
- Workflow: Colab + GitHub for sharing and version control

## ‚öñÔ∏è Note on Autocomplete and Generated Code

Some code in these notebooks was written with the help of autocomplete or AI-assisted suggestions from tools like Google Colab.

All code here is used for **personal learning** and **educational purposes only**, and is shared publicly to help students understand concepts and complete their own assignments.
